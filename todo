algorithm ideas:
1. prefix tree ("trie") based (hex or binary?):
    1. iterate through dataset1
        for each element, add [element,dataset.end] to tree
            tree node contains byteRange of entry(s)
        ...
    2. find matching small patterns
        expand out until differences are found
        search difference areas more carefully

act as front-end for multiple existing libraries? also implement own?
    rsync, xdelta, open-vcdiff (VCDIFF/RFC 3284), bsdiff
    xdelta diff: xdelta3.exe -e -s old_file new_file delta_file
    read and display this?


separate algorithms for replace vs insert?

v0.2 Feature list
    text log w/ optional popup display (bottom of window) for error/info messages
    fast full screen text rendering
    text highlighting
    content match indication

v0.3 Feature list
    basic comparison algorithm

later:
    QT Test?
    static analysis
    bug tracking?
    defensive coding, exhaustive switch statements, __FILE__ + __LINE__ macro

future features:
    comparison/analysis in separate threads
    QMessageLogger?
    split into qt UI + qt-free library for calculations?
